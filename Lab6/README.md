## Question

### 1. Create a dataset of hours studied and marks scored for 10 students.Calculate the covariance between the two variables.Plot the data using a scatter plot.
-> [1num.py]

### 2. Using the same dataset, compute the correlation coefficient.Interpret whether the relationship is positive, negative, or weak.Visualize it using a seaborn regression plot.
-> [2num.py]

### 3. Generate a dataset of daily temperature and ice-cream sales.Find the covariance between temperature and sales.Plot the relationship using a scatter plot.
-> [3num.py]

### 4. Calculate the correlation for the temperature vs ice-cream sales dataset.Compare the covariance and correlation value.
-> [4num.py]

### 5. Create two random numerical datasets with no clear relationship.Compute their covariance and correlation.Visualize them using a scatter plot and observe the pattern.
-> [5num.py]

### 6. Load a small dataset with height and weight values.Calculate mean, variance, covariance, and correlation.Plot the data using a seaborn jointplot.
-> [6num.py]

### 7. Create a dataset where one variable increases linearly and another increases randomly.Compute covariance and correlation.Plot both cases and compare the results.
-> [7num.py]
