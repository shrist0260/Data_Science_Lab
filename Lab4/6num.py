# Given a list of student names and a list of their corresponding scores, use the zip() function to pair them together 
# and then apply the reduce() function from the functools module to calculate the total sum of all scores.

# Use reduce to calculate the total sum of scores
total_score = reduce(lambda acc, pair: acc + pair[1], student_scores, 0)
