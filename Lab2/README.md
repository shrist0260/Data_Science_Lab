# Data Structure in python
## Questions:
### 1. Imagine a small store inventory like {"apple": 10, "banana": 5, "milk": 2}. Program should allow adding new items, selling items (subtract quantity), and print items that are low in stock (<3)

-> [1num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab2/1num.py)
### 2.Ask the user to input a list of movies with ratings like [("Titanic", 8), ("Inception", 9), ...]. Compute the average rating, find the highest-rated movie, and list all movies with rating above the average.

-> [2num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab2/2num.py)
### 3. Ask the user for a list of words. Reverse each word only if its length is even. Print the new list of words after processing.

-> [3num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab2/3num.py)
### 4. Represent a small map as a dictionary like {"A": {"B", "C"}, "B": {"A", "D"}, "C": {"A", "D"}, "D":{"B", "C"}}. Ask the user to input a path, e.g., ["A", "C", "D"]. Check if each consecutive step is connected and print "Valid path" or "Invalid path".

-> [4num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab2/4num.py)
### 5. Store student names as keys and marks (list of integers) as values in a dictionary. Compute each student’s average and grade (A/B/C/D). Print the top 2 students based on average marks

-> [5num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab2/5num.py)
### 6. Take a paragraph input from the user. Split it into words, remove duplicates, sort them alphabetically, and count the total number of unique words.

-> [6num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab2/6num.py)
