### ● Read the contents of the file and display them on the screen
### ● Handle the case where the file does not exist using try-except

-> [1num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab3/1num.py)
### 2. File Processing with Exception Handling
### ● Reads numbers from a text file (one number per line)
### ● Ignores invalid entries using exception handling
### ● Calculates and displays the sum and average of valid numbers

-> [2num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab3/2num.py)
### 3. CSV File Handling
### ● Read data from a CSV file containing student records (roll number, name, marks)
### ● Display all student records
### ● Handle file-related and data conversion errors using try-except

-> [3num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab3/3num.py)
### 4. Writing and Reading JSON Data
### ● Stores student details (ID, name, and marks) in a JSON file
### ● Reads the JSON file and displays the student information
### ● Handles exceptions related to file access and JSON decoding

-> [4num.py](https://github.com/shrist0260/Data_Science_Lab/blob/main/Lab3/4num.py)
